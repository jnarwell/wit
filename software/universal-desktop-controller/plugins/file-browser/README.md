## Installation

The File Browser plugin is included as a built-in plugin in the Universal Desktop Controller and requires no additional installation.

### Dependencies
- **chokidar**: File system watching
- **mime-types**: MIME type detection

## Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options in `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "rootPaths": {
    "type": "array",
    "default": "auto",
    "description": "Root paths accessible to the file browser"
  },
  "hiddenFiles": {
    "type": "boolean", 
    "default": true,
    "description": "Show hidden files and directories"
  },
  "followSymlinks": {
    "type": "boolean",
    "default": true, 
    "description": "Follow symbolic links when browsing"
  },
  "maxFileSize": {
    "type": "number",
    "default": 104857600,
    "description": "Maximum file size to read (100MB default)"
  }
}
```

## API Commands

### Navigation Commands
- `getRoots()` - Get all accessible root paths with disk usage
- `listDirectory(path, showHidden)` - List directory contents
- `getFileInfo(path)` - Get detailed file/directory information

### File Operations
- `readFile(path, encoding, start, end)` - Read file contents
- `writeFile(path, content, encoding, append)` - Write to file
- `createDirectory(path, recursive)` - Create directory
- `delete(path, recursive)` - Delete file or directory
- `rename(oldPath, newPath)` - Rename file or directory
- `copy(source, destination, recursive)` - Copy file or directory
- `move(source, destination)` - Move file or directory

### Advanced Operations
- `search(directory, pattern, options)` - Search for files
- `watchDirectory(path, recursive)` - Watch for file changes
- `openWithDefault(path)` - Open with system default app
- `compress(files, outputPath, format)` - Create archive
- `decompress(filePath, outputDir)` - Extract archive

### System Information
- `getSystemInfo()` - Get platform and user information
- `getDiskUsage(path)` - Get disk space information

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Operations
```javascript
// Get root paths
const roots = await sendCommand('file-browser', 'getRoots');

// List directory contents
const files = await sendCommand('file-browser', 'listDirectory', {
  path: '/Users/username/Documents',
  showHidden: false
});

// Create a new folder
await sendCommand('file-browser', 'createDirectory', {
  path: '/Users/username/Documents/NewFolder'
});

// Read a file
const content = await sendCommand('file-browser', 'readFile', {
  path: '/Users/username/Documents/test.txt',
  encoding: 'utf8'
});
```

### File Watching
```javascript
// Start watching a directory
await sendCommand('file-browser', 'watchDirectory', {
  path: '/Users/username/Projects',
  recursive: true
});

// File change events will be emitted automatically
```

## Frontend Integration

The File Browser includes a complete React-based UI accessible through the W.I.T. web interface:

### Features
- Dual-pane file manager interface
- Path breadcrumb navigation  
- Multi-select operations
- Drag-and-drop ready structure
- Search and filtering
- Context menus for file operations
- Progress indicators for long operations

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+A` - Select all files
- `Delete` - Delete selected files
- `F2` - Rename selected file
- `Ctrl+C` - Copy selected files
- `Ctrl+X` - Cut selected files  
- `Ctrl+V` - Paste files
- `Enter` - Open file/navigate into directory

## Platform Support

### Windows
- Full NTFS file system support
- Windows-specific paths and drives (C:\, D:\, etc.)
- PowerShell integration for compression
- Windows file associations

### macOS
- HFS+ and APFS file system support
- Unix permissions and symbolic links
- Spotlight integration capabilities
- macOS file associations and Quick Look

### Linux
- EXT4, XFS, and other Linux file systems
- Full Unix permissions support
- Package manager integration potential
- Desktop environment file associations

## Security Considerations

1. **Path Validation**: All file paths are normalized and validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
2. **Permission Checks**: File system permissions are respected and checked before operations  
3. **Access Control**: Root paths can be restricted to specific directories
4. **Resource Limits**: File size limits prevent memory exhaustion attacks
5. **Audit Trail**: All file operations are logged for security monitoring

## Error Handling

The plugin provides detailed error messages for common scenarios:
- Permission denied errors with suggested solutions
- File not found errors with path validation
- Disk space errors with available space information
- Network path errors for remote file systems

## Performance

- **Efficient Directory Listing**: Optimized for large directories (tested with 1750+ files)
- **Streaming File Operations**: Large files are processed in chunks
- **Caching**: Directory metadata is cached to improve navigation speed
- **Background Operations**: File watching and indexing don't block the UI

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure the UDC process has appropriate file system permissions
2. **Large File Handling**: Adjust `maxFileSize` configuration for larger files
3. **Network Paths**: Some network file systems may require additional configuration
4. **Symbolic Links**: Broken symbolic links are handled gracefully

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the plugin's debug flag:
```javascript
// In plugin initialization
this.debug = true;
```

## Development

### Architecture
- **Base Class**: Extends `WITPlugin` for consistent plugin behavior
- **Event Driven**: Uses Node.js EventEmitter for file system events
- **Promise Based**: All operations return promises for async handling
- **Error Resilient**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Testing
- Unit tests for core file operations
- Integration tests with various file systems
- Performance tests with large directories
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
