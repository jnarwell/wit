# Backend Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Project & Task Storage
- Added `projects_db = []` and `tasks_db = []` to store projects and tasks in memory
- These were referenced but not defined, causing crashes

### 2. Project Endpoints
- All project endpoints now handle both ID formats:
  - `id` (UUID format): `"3f4e5d6c-7b8a-9c0d-1e2f-3a4b5c6d7e8f"`
  - `project_id` (code format): `"PROJ-0001"`
- Fixed endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` - Get individual project
  - `PUT /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` - Update project
  - `DELETE /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` - Delete project

### 3. Task Endpoints
- Updated task field names to match frontend expectations:
  - Using `name` instead of `title`
  - Using `assigned_to` instead of `assignee`
  - Using `task_id` format like `TASK-0001`
- Added `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}` endpoint
- All task endpoints now handle both ID formats

### 4. Admin Panel Integration
- Fixed user creation to persist to `users_db`
- Fixed user deletion to remove from `users_db`
- Fixed user listing to show real users from `users_db`
- Admin stats now reflect actual user counts

### 5. File Operations
- Implemented real file system operations using pathlib
- Files are stored in `./wit_storage/users/` and `./wit_storage/projects/`
- All CRUD operations work with actual files

## How to Test

1. **Restart the dev server**:
   ```bash
   python dev_server.py
   ```

2. **Test project operations**:
   ```bash
   python test_project_endpoints.py
   ```

3. **Test admin panel**:
   ```bash
   python test_admin_panel.py
   ```

## Key Changes to Remember

1. Projects have both `id` and `project_id` fields
2. Tasks have both `id` and `task_id` fields
3. All endpoints accept either format for lookups
4. File operations use real filesystem, not mock storage
5. User management is integrated with the auth system

## Frontend Compatibility

The backend now properly handles:
- Project deletion by `PROJ-XXXX` format IDs
- Task creation with proper field names
- File operations with real storage
- User authentication and persistence
