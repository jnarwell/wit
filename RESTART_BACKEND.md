# Backend Restart Required

The backend server needs to be restarted to apply all the file management fixes.

## Current Status

The backend is running but using the old code. The errors you're seeing:
- 404 for /delete and /update endpoints
- File creation failing with path errors
- Paths still showing "default_user" prefix

All of these have been fixed in the code but require a restart.

## How to Restart

1. Stop the current server:
   - Find the terminal running `python dev_server.py`
   - Press Ctrl+C to stop it

2. Start the server again:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jmarwell/Documents/wit/software/backend
   python dev_server.py
   ```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Path handling** - User files no longer show "default_user" prefix
2. **Rename operation** - Frontend sends correct field names
3. **Delete operation** - Accepts base_dir and project_id
4. **Update operation** - Accepts base_dir and project_id
5. **Upload operation** - Accepts all frontend fields
6. **Create operation** - Proper path validation

## Testing After Restart

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
cd /Users/jmarwell/Documents/wit
python3 test_file_operations.py
```

Expected output:
- âœ“ All operations should pass
- No "default_user" prefix in paths
- No 404 or 500 errors

## UI Testing

After restart, test in the UI:
1. Create files/folders
2. View and edit files
3. Rename files
4. Delete files
5. Upload files via drag & drop

All operations should work without errors.
