# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-23

### Added
- Created a new, clean database schema with `User` and `Project` models.
- Implemented a `CreateUserPage.tsx` on the frontend with a corresponding API endpoint to allow new user registration.
- Re-implemented the `projects_router.py` with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting projects.
- Added a `Task` model and a `tasks_router.py` to support basic task management within projects.

### Fixed
- Resolved a persistent server crashing issue by removing all legacy database models and API routers that were causing import errors.
- Corrected a React Hooks error in `ProjectsPage.tsx` that was caused by calling `useRef` inside a conditional block.
- Fixed multiple syntax and import errors in `AuthContext.tsx`, `dev_server.py`, and various router files.

### Removed
- Deleted a large number of obsolete and duplicate files, including old database models, schemas, and backup files, to clean up the codebase.
