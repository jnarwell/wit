# Backend Needs Another Restart

## What Was Just Fixed

The backend was returning file paths with project IDs included (like "PROJ-0001/file.txt") but expecting paths without the prefix when performing operations. This has been fixed.

### Changes Made:

1. **get_project_specific_files** - Now returns paths without project_id prefix
2. **get_file_content** - Strips project_id prefix from paths 
3. **delete_file** - Strips project_id prefix from paths
4. **update_file** - Strips project_id prefix from paths  
5. **rename_file** - Strips project_id prefix from both old and new paths

## Why This Matters

Without these fixes, project file operations were failing with 404 errors because:
- Frontend receives: "PROJ-0001/file.txt"
- Frontend sends: "PROJ-0001/file.txt"
- Backend was looking for: "projects/PROJ-0001/PROJ-0001/file.txt" ❌

Now it correctly looks for: "projects/PROJ-0001/file.txt" ✅

## To Apply Changes

1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
2. Start it again:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jmarwell/Documents/wit/software/backend
   python3 dev_server.py
   ```

## After Restart

All project file operations should work:
- ✅ View project files (no prefix in paths)
- ✅ Create files in projects
- ✅ Edit and save project files
- ✅ Rename project files
- ✅ Delete project files
- ✅ Upload files to projects

The user files were already working correctly and will continue to work.
