### Feature: AI Terminal Assistant

-   **Initial Implementation**: Created a full-screen, interactive terminal interface as the primary "WIT" page.
-   **AI Integration**: Connected the terminal to the Claude API, allowing for natural language command processing.
-   **Database Context**: Enhanced the AI with the ability to read from the `wit.db` database, providing it with user-specific context about their projects and equipment.
-   **Tooling System**: Implemented a robust "tool" system that allows the AI to perform actions, such as:
    -   Creating, listing, updating, and deleting projects.
    -   Adding, listing, and checking the status of equipment.
-   **Chat Persistence**: Added `localStorage` integration to save the terminal's chat history, preserving the conversation between sessions.
-   **Conversational Context**: The AI now remembers the last 10 messages, allowing for follow-up questions and a more natural conversation flow.
-   **Enhanced UX**: The terminal now supports copy/paste and arrow key navigation for a more intuitive user experience.

### Backend Stability

-   **Data Integrity**: Fixed numerous critical bugs, including a `MultipleResultsFound` error caused by duplicate entries in the database.
-   **API Routing**: Resolved several `ImportError` and `NameError` issues by cleaning up unused routers and correcting invalid imports.
-   **Error Handling**: Improved frontend error handling to prevent infinite reload loops when encountering 404 errors.
