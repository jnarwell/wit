## Task Management

### Create Tasks
- "Add a task 'Design circuit board' to project PROJ-ABC123"

- "Change priority of TASK-XYZ789 to high"
- "Update status of 'Design circuit' task to in-progress"
- "Assign task TASK-123456 to john.doe"

### Delete Tasks
- "Delete task TASK-ABC123"
- "Remove the 'Old task' from my project"

## Team Management

### Add Team Members
- "Add john.doe as an editor to project PROJ-ABC123"
- "Give jane.smith admin access to my robotics project"
- "Add mike@example.com as a viewer to project PROJ-XYZ789"

### View Team
- "Who's working on project PROJ-ABC123?"
- "List team members for my robotics project"
- "Show me the team for project PROJ-XYZ789"

### Remove Members
- "Remove john.doe from project PROJ-ABC123"
- "Take jane.smith off the robotics project team"

## Analytics & Reports

### Project Progress
- "How's the progress on project PROJ-ABC123?"
- "Show me completion rate for my robotics project"
- "What percentage of tasks are done in project PROJ-XYZ789?"

### Project Statistics
- "Give me full statistics for project PROJ-ABC123"
- "How many tasks and members in my robotics project?"
- "Show project metrics for PROJ-XYZ789"

### Search & Filter
- "Find all my high priority tasks"
- "Show projects with pending tasks"
- "List tasks due this week"

## Complex Commands

The WIT AI can understand complex, natural language requests:

- "Create a new project for building a 3D printer, add tasks for designing the frame, sourcing components, and assembly, then add john.doe as an editor"
- "Show me the progress of all my active projects and highlight any overdue tasks"
- "Update all pending tasks in my robotics project to in-progress and assign them to the team"
- "Give me a summary of what everyone is working on across all my projects"

## Tips

1. **Natural Language**: You don't need to use exact syntax. WIT understands natural language.
2. **Context Awareness**: WIT remembers the context of your conversation.
3. **Bulk Operations**: You can ask WIT to perform multiple operations in one command.
4. **Smart Suggestions**: WIT can provide suggestions based on your project status.

## Examples in Action

```
You: What's the status of my projects?
WIT: I'll check the status of all your projects...

[Shows list of projects with progress bars, task counts, and team sizes]

You: Create a task to review the code in my robotics project
WIT: I'll create that task for you in your robotics project...

Task created successfully:
- ID: TASK-A1B2C3D4
- Name: Review the code
- Project: Autonomous Navigation Robot (PROJ-ROB12345)
- Priority: medium
- Status: pending

You: Assign it to jane.smith with high priority
WIT: I'll update the task to assign it to jane.smith and set high priority...

Task updated successfully:
- Assigned to: jane.smith
- Priority: high

You: How many tasks does Jane have now?
WIT: Let me check Jane's task assignments across your projects...

Jane Smith has 4 tasks assigned:
- 2 in "Autonomous Navigation Robot" (1 pending, 1 in-progress)
- 2 in "Smart Home Automation" (both in-progress)
