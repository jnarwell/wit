# Home Page Implementation

## What Was Created

### 1. HomePage Component (`/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`)
- Terminal-style interface with ASCII art W.I.T. logo
- Three selectable options:
  - [1] Sign In → navigates to `/login`
  - [2] Sign Up → navigates to `/signup`
  - [3] Learn More → navigates to `/about`
- Keyboard navigation:
  - Number keys (1-3) for direct selection
  - Arrow keys (↑/↓) for navigation
  - Enter to select
- Mouse support:
  - Click to select
  - Hover to highlight
- Auto-redirect if user is already authenticated

### 2. HomePage Styles (`/src/pages/HomePage.css`)
- Dark terminal theme with green text
- Realistic terminal window with red/yellow/green buttons
- Blinking cursor animation
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Smooth hover and selection effects

### 3. AboutPage Component (`/src/pages/AboutPage.tsx`)
- Information about W.I.T.
- Features list with emoji icons
- Coming soon features
- Back to home button

### 4. AboutPage Styles (`/src/pages/AboutPage.css`)
- Consistent dark theme
- Clean, readable layout
- Hover effects on buttons

## Routing Updates

### App.tsx Changes
- Added HomePage as the default route (`/`)
- Added AboutPage route (`/about`)
- Imported both new components
- Routes order:
  1. `/` → HomePage
  2. `/about` → AboutPage
  3. `/login` → LoginPage
  4. `/signup` → SignupPage
  5. Other routes → AppContent (protected)

### Navigation Updates
- Logout now redirects to HomePage (`/`) instead of login page

## User Flow

1. **New User**:
   - Lands on HomePage
   - Can choose Sign In, Sign Up, or Learn More
   - Keyboard or mouse navigation

2. **Returning User**:
   - If not authenticated → HomePage
   - If authenticated → Auto-redirect to Dashboard

3. **Logged In User**:
   - Logout → Returns to HomePage
