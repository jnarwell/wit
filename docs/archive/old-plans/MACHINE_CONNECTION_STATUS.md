# W.I.T. Machine Connection Status Report
**Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Last Test**: 09:47 AM

## Executive Summary
The W.I.T. platform's temperature control system has been successfully integrated with the printer bridge architecture. Commands are properly routed from the web UI through the backend to the bridge, which translates them to printer-specific G-code. The primary remaining issue is network connectivity to the physical printer.

## Current Architecture Status

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. **Frontend Temperature Controls**
- **Location**: `SpecificWidget.tsx` and `MachineDetailPage.tsx`
- **Status**: Fully functional
- **Features**:
  - Temperature input controls for nozzle and bed
  - Real-time temperature display
  - Command status feedback (BRIDGE vs SIMULATION mode)
  - Proper API integration with backend

#### 2. **Backend Command Routing**
- **Location**: `dev_server.py` (lines 1534-1764)
- **Status**: Fully functional
- **Features**:
  - Receives commands at `/api/v1/equipment/printers/{printer_id}/commands`
  - Routes to bridge when connected
  - Falls back to simulation when bridge unavailable
  - Enhanced logging shows bridge connection status
  - Fixed missing `time` module import

#### 3. **Bridge WebSocket Connection**
- **Location**: `dev_server.py` (lines 2128-2198)
- **Status**: Fully functional
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/printer-bridge/{printer_id}`
- **Features**:
  - Accepts bridge connections
  - Maintains connection registry
  - Forwards commands to connected bridges
  - Handles disconnection cleanup

#### 4. **Printer Bridge Application**
- **Location**: `scripts/application/wit_printer_bridge.py`
- **Status**: Functionally complete, pending printer connectivity
- **Features**:
  - Connects to W.I.T. backend via WebSocket
  - Receives temperature commands
  - Translates to G-code (M104 for nozzle, M140 for bed)
  - Implements PrusaLink API v1 integration

### ⚠️ Active Issues

#### 1. **Printer Network Connectivity**
- **Issue**: Connection timeout to printer at `http://192.168.1.131`
- **Error**: `HTTPConnectionPool: Max retries exceeded with url: /api/v1/status`
- **Likely Causes**:
  - Printer IP address has changed (DHCP)
  - Printer is offline or in sleep mode
  - Network isolation between development machine and printer
- **Next Steps**:
  - Verify current printer IP address
  - Check printer network settings
  - Test direct browser access to printer

#### 2. **PrusaLink Authentication**
- **Status**: Partially resolved
- **Issue**: Initial attempts used PrusaConnect API key instead of PrusaLink API key
- **Solution**: Must use local PrusaLink API key from printer's web interface (Settings → Network → PrusaLink API key)
- **Note**: Different printer IDs were used in testing (M1755456196907, M1755467401659, M1755476288857, etc.)

#### 3. **G-code Execution Method**
- **Status**: Implemented but untested
- **Current Implementation**: 
  - Creates temporary .gcode file with command
  - Uploads via PUT to `/api/v1/files/local/wit_temp.gcode`
  - Uses `Print-After-Upload: 1` header for immediate execution
- **Based on**: PrusaLink OpenAPI spec and community workarounds
- **Note**: PrusaLink doesn't have direct G-code command API (confirmed via GitHub issue #832)

## Test Results Log

### Successful Tests
1. ✅ Backend receives commands from frontend
2. ✅ Backend recognizes bridge connections
3. ✅ Commands route to bridge when connected
4. ✅ Bridge receives and processes commands
5. ✅ G-code generation works correctly (M104 S50, M140 S40, etc.)
6. ✅ Frontend displays connection status (BRIDGE vs SIMULATION)

### Failed Tests
1. ❌ G-code upload to PrusaLink (403 Forbidden - wrong API key type)
2. ❌ Final printer connection (timeout - network issue)

## Command Flow Diagram
```
User Input (Web UI)
    ↓
SpecificWidget.tsx / MachineDetailPage.tsx
    ↓
POST /api/v1/equipment/printers/{id}/commands
    ↓
dev_server.py (checks bridge_connections)
    ↓
If Bridge Connected:
    WebSocket → wit_printer_bridge.py
    ↓
    Translate to G-code
    ↓
    PUT /api/v1/files/local/wit_temp.gcode
    ↓
    Execute on Printer
```

## Known Bugs & Limitations

### 1. **PrusaLink API Limitations**
- No direct G-code command endpoint
- Must use file upload workaround
- No real-time command feedback
- Temperature commands require special handling

### 2. **Multiple Printer ID Management**
- System creates new printer IDs on each add
- Old IDs remain in localStorage
- Need cleanup mechanism for orphaned printers

### 3. **WebSocket Reconnection**
- Frontend WebSocket occasionally disconnects/reconnects
- Doesn't affect functionality but creates log noise

## Required Information for Next Session

### 1. **Printer Details**
- Current IP address (check printer display)
- PrusaLink API key (from printer web interface)
- Printer model and firmware version
- Network configuration (same subnet as dev machine?)

### 2. **Test Commands**
```bash
# Find printer IP
ping 192.168.1.131  # Or check router/printer display

# Test bridge with correct IP
./scripts/application/start_bridge.sh PRINTER_ID --printer-url http://CORRECT_IP

# When prompted, use PrusaLink API key (not PrusaConnect)
```

### 3. **Debug Steps**
1. Verify printer web interface is accessible
2. Check PrusaLink is enabled on printer
3. Get correct API key from local interface
4. Test with correct printer ID and IP

## File Modifications Summary

### Modified Files
1. `/software/backend/dev_server.py`
   - Added `import time` (line 35)
   - Enhanced bridge logging (lines 2139, 2147)
   - Improved command feedback (lines 1608-1609, 1689-1690, 1762-1763)

2. `/software/frontend/web/src/components/widgets/SpecificWidget.tsx`
   - Added bridge status logging (lines 275-278)

3. `/software/frontend/web/src/pages/MachineDetailPage.tsx`
   - Added bridge status logging (lines 127-130)

4. `/scripts/application/wit_printer_bridge.py`
   - Implemented PrusaLink API v1 file upload method (lines 265-354)
   - Uses PUT request with proper headers
   - Handles Print-After-Upload functionality

### Launch Scripts
- `/scripts/application/start_bridge.sh` - Unchanged, works correctly

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Immediate Tasks**:
   - Verify printer IP address and connectivity
   - Test with correct PrusaLink API key
   - Monitor bridge logs for successful G-code execution

2. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Add printer IP configuration to UI
   - Store PrusaLink API key securely
   - Implement connection retry logic
   - Add G-code execution feedback mechanism

3. **Testing Protocol**:
   - Start with simple temperature command (e.g., bed to 30°C)
   - Monitor printer display for temperature changes
   - Check PrusaLink web interface for activity
   - Verify no print jobs are started (temperature only)

## Success Criteria
The system will be considered fully functional when:
1. Temperature commands sent from UI reach the printer
2. Printer display shows temperature changes
3. No error messages in bridge logs
4. Commands work consistently without manual intervention
