# Backend Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. File Creation (422 Error)
- Updated `CreateRequest` model to match frontend format
- Added support for `base_dir`, `project_id`, `name`, and `is_dir` fields
- Fixed path parsing logic to handle various formats

### 2. File Content Viewing (405 Error)
- Added GET `/content` endpoint with Query parameters
- Supports `path`, `base_dir`, and `project_id` parameters

### 3. Project Files Endpoint (404 Error)
- Added GET `/project/{project_id}` endpoint
- Creates project directory if it doesn't exist

### 4. WebSocket Endpoints
- Added `/ws/project/{project_id}` for project-specific file updates
- Added `/ws/files` for general file updates

### 5. Project PATCH Endpoint (405 Error)
- Added PATCH endpoint in `dev_server.py` that mirrors PUT functionality

### 6. Equipment WebSocket
- Added `/ws/equipment` endpoint at correct path

### 7. File Update (405 Error)
- Changed frontend to use PUT instead of POST for updates
- Backend already had PUT endpoint at `/update`

### 8. Rename Operation (422 Error)
- Changed frontend to send `old_path` instead of `path` to match backend's `RenameRequest` model

### 9. File Upload (422 Error)
- Updated upload endpoints to accept `base_dir` and `project_id` form fields
- Fixed path construction logic for both single and folder uploads

## Next Steps

1. Restart the backend server to apply all changes
2. Test all file operations:
   - Create file/folder
   - View file content
   - Edit and save files
   - Rename files/folders
   - Delete files/folders
   - Upload files/folders
   - Drag and drop upload

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Restart backend
cd software/backend
python dev_server.py

# Frontend should already be running
# Test all operations through the UI
```
