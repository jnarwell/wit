# Backend File Management - Final Fixes

## Summary of All Changes

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### ProjectFileBrowser.tsx
- Changed rename request to send `old_path` instead of `path`

#### FileBrowser.tsx  
- Changed rename request to send `old_path` instead of `path`

#### FileViewer.tsx
- Updated file update to send `base_dir` and `project_id` along with path and content

### 2. Backend Changes (files_api_simple.py)

#### Model Updates
- Added `base_dir` and `project_id` to `RenameRequest`
- Added `base_dir` and `project_id` to `DeleteRequest`
- Added `base_dir` and `project_id` to `UpdateRequest`
- Made `path` parameter optional (empty string default) in upload endpoints

#### Endpoint Fixes

**GET /user**
- Changed to use `user_dir` as base path instead of `USER_FILES_DIR`
- This ensures returned paths don't include "default_user" prefix

**POST /create**
- Updated to use proper base directory for file info generation
- Returns paths relative to user or project directory

**POST /rename**
- Updated to handle `base_dir` and `project_id` parameters
- Properly determines base directory for both user and project files

**POST /delete**
- Updated to handle `base_dir` and `project_id` parameters
- Properly determines file path based on context

**POST /upload**
- Added support for `base_dir` and `project_id` form fields
- Fixed file info generation to use correct base path

**POST /upload-folder**
- Updated parameter name from `path` to `base_path` to match frontend
- Added support for `base_dir` and `project_id` form fields

**PUT /update**
- Updated to handle `base_dir` and `project_id` parameters
- Properly determines file path and info base

### 3. Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Path Handling**: All endpoints now handle paths relative to the user or project directory, not the storage root
2. **No More Path Duplication**: Fixed the "default_user/default_user" path duplication issue
3. **Frontend-Backend Alignment**: All endpoints now accept the same parameters the frontend sends
4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Fallback logic preserved for old API calls

## Testing

After restarting the backend, run the test script:

```bash
cd /Users/jmarwell/Documents/wit
python3 test_file_operations.py
```

This will verify:
- File listing (paths should not include "default_user")
- File creation
- Content viewing
- File updates
- Renaming
- Uploads
- Deletion
- Project file operations

## Next Steps

1. Restart the backend server
2. Run the test script
3. Test through the UI to ensure all operations work correctly
4. Clean up any duplicate "default_user/default_user" directories created during testing
