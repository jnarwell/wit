# W.I.T. Attributions and Acknowledgments

This document acknowledges the open-source projects and resources that have inspired or influenced the W.I.T. project. While W.I.T. is an original implementation, we have learned valuable architectural patterns and best practices from studying these excellent projects.

## Architectural Inspirations

### OctoEverywhere
**Repository**: [OctoPrint-OctoEverywhere](https://github.com/QuinnDamerell/OctoPrint-OctoEverywhere)  
**License**: AGPLv3  
**What We Learned**:
- Universal printer control architecture patterns
- Plugin-based system design for 3D printer integrations
- WebSocket communication strategies for real-time updates
- Multi-protocol printer support approaches

The OctoEverywhere project's approach to creating a universal interface for different printer types inspired our Machine Manager architecture. We studied their patterns for abstracting printer communications and adapted these concepts to create our own implementation.

### OctoPrint
**Repository**: [OctoPrint](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint)  
**License**: AGPLv3  
**What We Learned**:
- Plugin architecture design patterns
- Real-time printer monitoring techniques
- G-code handling and queuing strategies
- Web-based printer control interfaces

OctoPrint's extensive plugin system influenced our approach to creating the Universal Desktop Controller's plugin architecture.

### PrusaLink/PrusaConnect
**Documentation**: [Prusa Developer Docs](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Link)  
**What We Learned**:
- REST API design for 3D printer control
- Status reporting data structures
- Network printer discovery methods

### Home Assistant
**Repository**: [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core)  
**License**: Apache 2.0  
**What We Learned**:
- Component-based architecture for IoT devices
- Real-time state management patterns
- Plugin/integration system design
- WebSocket API patterns

Home Assistant's approach to managing diverse IoT devices influenced our equipment management system design.

## Technical Patterns

### FastAPI
**Repository**: [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)  
**License**: MIT  
**Usage**: Direct dependency - W.I.T. backend is built with FastAPI

### React
**Repository**: [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)  
**License**: MIT  
**Usage**: Direct dependency - W.I.T. frontend is built with React

### Electron
**Repository**: [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)  
**License**: MIT  
**Usage**: Direct dependency - Universal Desktop Controller is built with Electron

### Material Design
**Resource**: [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/)  
**What We Learned**:
- Industrial design language principles
- Accessibility considerations
- Touch-friendly interface patterns

While W.I.T. uses its own industrial design language, we studied Material Design principles for creating consistent, usable interfaces.

## Algorithm and Pattern References

### WebSocket Reconnection Strategy
Inspired by patterns commonly used in real-time applications, particularly:
- Socket.io's reconnection logic
- SignalR's connection resilience patterns

### Plugin Sandboxing
Studied security models from:
- Chrome Extension API security model
- VS Code Extension Host architecture
- Electron's context isolation

### State Management
Influenced by patterns from:
- Redux for predictable state updates
- MobX for reactive programming
- Zustand for lightweight state management
